We need to use ARIA attributes to tell the screen reader that this <div> is not just text — it’s something the user can interact with.
•	We use role="checkbox" to tell the screen reader that each skill acts like a checkbox.
•	We use aria-checked="false" to indicate that the item is currently not selected.
•	We use tabindex="0" to make the element focusable using the Tab key.
•	We use aria-labelledby to connect each skill with its corresponding label so the screen reader reads the correct name.
